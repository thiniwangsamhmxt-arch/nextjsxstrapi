**Code Quality & Architecture:**

1. **Project Structure:**
   ```
   /src
     /api (Content-types, controllers, services)
     /plugins (Custom plugins)
     /extensions (Admin panel customizations)
     /config (Environment configurations)
     /middlewares (Custom middleware)
     /policies (Access control policies)
   /tests (Unit and integration tests)
   /docs (API documentation)
   /scripts (Deployment and migration scripts)
   ```

2. **Development Standards:**
   - Follow Strapi v5 best practices and conventions
   - Implement comprehensive error handling with custom error classes
   - Use environment variables for all configuration
   - Include detailed JSDoc comments for all functions
   - Implement proper logging with different levels (debug, info, warn, error)

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Unit tests for all services and controllers (minimum 80% coverage)
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
   - Performance tests for high-load scenarios

**Deployment & DevOps:**

1. **Repository Setup:**
   - Implement GitFlow branching strategy
   - Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
   - Include environment configuration templates (.env.example)
   - Add pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
   - Automated deployment to staging and production
   - Database migration scripts with rollback capabilities

3. **Documentation Requirements:**
   - API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Admin user guide with screenshots
   - Developer setup and contribution guide
   - Deployment and maintenance documentation

**Deliverables Checklist:**
- [ ] Complete Strapi v5 application with TypeScript
- [ ] All custom plugins and extensions
- [ ] Social media API integrations with error handling
- [ ] Responsive admin interface with custom components
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with coverage reports
- [ ] Docker configuration and deployment scripts
- [ ] Complete documentation set
- [ ] Environment configuration templates
- [ ] Database seeds and migration scripts

**Success Criteria:**
The application should be production-ready, scalable to handle 10,000+ posts per day, support 100+ concurrent users, and maintain 99.9% uptime. All code must pass linting, testing, and security checks before deployment.

**Timeline Expectation:**
Provide a realistic development timeline and break down the implementation into logical phases (setup, core features, integrations, testing, deployment).

Begin implementation immediately, ensuring each component is thoroughly tested and documented before proceeding to the next phase.
